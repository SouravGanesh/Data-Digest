Apache Kafka has gained significant popularity in recent years, with companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and Uber leveraging its capabilities to handle high-volume data streams efficiently.


To help you grasp the key concepts of Kafka, I've created a handy diagram that breaks them down in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲𝗿: A Kafka producer is an entity responsible for publishing data to specific topics within the Kafka cluster. These producers act as the sources of data streams, which can originate from various applications, systems, or sensors. They push records into Kafka topics, with each record consisting of a key, a value, and a timestamp.

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗿: A Kafka consumer, on the other hand, pulls data from the Kafka topics to which it subscribes. Consumers process the data and often belong to a consumer group. Within a group, multiple consumers can read from a topic in parallel, with each consumer responsible for reading from specific partitions, ensuring efficient data processing.

𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗶𝗰: A topic in Kafka represents a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics are multi-subscriber, meaning they can be consumed by multiple consumers and consumer groups simultaneously. To enable data scalability and parallel processing, topics are divided into partitions.

𝗣𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: A topic can be split into partitions, which are essentially subsets of the topic's data. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to. By splitting data across multiple brokers, partitions allow topics to be parallelized for enhanced performance.

𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗿: A broker refers to a single Kafka server that forms part of the Kafka cluster. Brokers are responsible for maintaining the published data, and each broker may have zero or more partitions per topic. They can handle data for multiple topics simultaneously.

𝗖𝗹𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿: A Kafka cluster is composed of one or more brokers working together to provide scalability, fault tolerance, and load balancing. The cluster manages the persistence and replication of message data across the brokers.

𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮: A replica is a copy of a partition that Kafka creates to ensure data is not lost if a broker fails. Replicas are classified as either leader replicas or follower replicas, each serving a specific purpose.

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮: For each partition, one broker is designated as the leader. The leader replica handles all read and write requests for that partition, while other replicas simply copy the data from the leader.

𝗙𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮: Follower replicas are copies of the leader replica for a partition. Their purpose is to provide redundancy and take over as the leader if the current leader fails. They replicate the leader's log but do not serve client requests directly.

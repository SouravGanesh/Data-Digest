Data modeling encompasses various processes. Here's a breakdown:

- **Normalization of Tables:** This is indeed a part of data modeling. Normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency.
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling:** ER modeling is a technique for conceptualizing the structure of a database. It involves identifying entities (things about which data is stored) and the relationships between them.
- **Data Definition:** This involves defining the structure of the data to be stored in the database, including tables, columns, data types, constraints, etc.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the integrity of the data through constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, etc., is a crucial part of data modeling.
- **Performance Optimization:** Data modeling also involves optimizing the database structure for performance, considering factors like indexing, partitioning, denormalization, etc.
- **Data Modeling Tools:** Using specialized software or tools to visually represent the database structure, relationships, and constraints.
- **Data Governance and Documentation:** Documenting the data model and ensuring compliance with organizational standards and governance policies.

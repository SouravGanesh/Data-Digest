Key concepts:

- Repository - Where your project files and commit history are stored
- Commit - A snapshot of changes, like a version checkpoint 
- Branch - A timeline of commits that lets you work on parallel versions
- Merge - To combine changes from separate branches
- Pull request - Propose & review changes before merging branches

Key commands:

- git init - Initialize a new repo
- git status - View changed files not staged for commit
- git add - Stage files for commit
- git commit - Commit staged snapshot 
- git branch - List, create, or delete branches
- git checkout - Switch between branches
- git merge - Join two development histories (branches)
- git push/pull - Send/receive commits to remote repo

With these basic concepts and commands, you can leverage GIT to track changes, work in branches, and collaborate with others.
